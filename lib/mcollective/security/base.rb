        # This is a base class the other security modules should inherit from
        # it handles statistics and validation of messages that should in most 
        # cases apply to all security models.
        # 
        # To create your own security plugin you should provide a plugin that inherits
        # from this and provides the following methods:
        #
        # decodemsg      - Decodes a message that was received from the middleware
        # encodereply    - Encodes a reply message to a previous request message
        # encoderequest  - Encodes a new request message
        # validrequest?  - Validates a request received from the middleware
        # 
        # Specifics of each of these are a bit fluid and the interfaces for this is not
        # set in stone yet, specifically the encode methods will be provided with a helper
        # that takes care of encoding the core requirements.  The best place to see how security
        # works is by looking at the provided MCollective::Security::PSK plugin.
