#summary Introduction to using Simple RPC

= Introduction =

MCollective is a framework for writing feature full agents and clients and provides a [WritingAgents rich system to do that].  Sometimes though you just have simpler needs than the full Client provides or need to prototype something quickly.  MCollective Simple RPC is a framework ontop of the standard client that abstracts away a lot of the complexity.

A bit of code probably says more than lots of english, so here's a simple hello world Agent, it just echo's back everything you send it:

{{{
module Mcollective
    module Agent
        class Echo<RPC::Agent
            # Basic echo server
            def echo_action
                validate :msg, String
     
                reply.data = request[:msg]
            end
        end
    end
end
}}}


And here is the client for it:

{{{
#!/usr/bin/ruby
 
require 'mcollective'
 
include MCollective::RPC
 
mc = rpcclient("echo")
printrpc mc.echo(:msg => "Hello World")
}}}

When run you should see something like this:

{{{
$ rpctest.rb --with-class /devel/ --verbose
dev1.your.com                          : OK
    "hello world"
}}}

As you can see it supports full discovery and filters and you had to do nothing fancy to produce acceptable output from the command.
