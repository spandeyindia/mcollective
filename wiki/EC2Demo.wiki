#summary Test out mcollective using Amazon EC2
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

We've created a Amazon hosted demo of mcollective that can give you a quick feel for how things work without all the hassle of setting up from scratch.

It would also be a good test bed for new agents etc.

= AMIs =

The AMI is based in the _EU West_ availability zone, we currently have just the one AMI id that is running mcollective 0.4.1.

|| *AMI ID* || *Description* ||
||ami-11ffd465||Server and Node for MCollective 0.4.1||
||ami-21c8e355||Server and Node for MCollective 0.4.2||

The video shows you the basic steps to get it going using the [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/ Amazon Console].

We can create a copy of it in the US if there's demand for that.

= Security Groups = 
Just in case it's not clear in the video you should open ports _22_ and _6163_ to make sure it all works, technically you only need to open 6163 on the main server only the rest only need it for outgoing.

= Starting main node = 
To start the main node you need to provide some user data:

{{{
mcollective=server
}}}

and then once it's up you should run the _start-mcollective-demo.rb_ as root to bootstrap the first node, it'll provide user data that you should then give to all the test nodes you want to boot.

= Agents = 
The images all have the basic agents going as well as some community ones:

 * [http://code.google.com/p/mcollective-plugins/wiki/AgentService Puppet based Service]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/mcollective-plugins/wiki/AgentPuppetPackage Puppet based Package]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/mcollective-plugins/wiki/AgentNRPE NRPE]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/mcollective-plugins/wiki/RegistrationMetaData Meta Registration]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/mcollective-plugins/wiki/AgentUrltest URL Tester]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/mcollective-plugins/wiki/UtilitiesSSH Discovery Aware SSH]

= Registration = 
The main node will have [Registration] setup and the community [http://code.google.com/p/mcollective-plugins/wiki/AgentRegistrationMonitor Registration Monitor] agent, look in _/var/tmp/mcollective_ for meta data from all your nodes.

The current AMI has 1 x left over file there from when I was building the AMI.
