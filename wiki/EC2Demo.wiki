#summary Test out mcollective using Amazon EC2

= Introduction =

We've created a Amazon hosted demo of mcollective that can give you a quick feel for how things work without all the hassle of setting up from scratch.

It would also be a good test bed for new agents etc.

= AMIs =

The AMI is based in the _EU West_ availability zone, we currently have just the one AMI id that is running mcollective 0.4.1.

|| *AMI ID* || *Description* ||
||ami-11ffd465||Server and Node for MCollective 0.4.1||

The video shows you the basic steps to get it going using the [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/ Amazon Console].

We can create a copy of it in the US if there's demand for that.

= Agents = 
The images all have the basic agents going as well as some community ones:

 * [http://code.google.com/p/mcollective-plugins/wiki/AgentService Puppet based Service]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/mcollective-plugins/wiki/AgentPuppetPackage Puppet based Package]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/mcollective-plugins/wiki/AgentNRPE NRPE]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/mcollective-plugins/wiki/RegistrationMetaData Meta Registration]


= Registration = 
The main node will have [Registration] setup and the community [http://code.google.com/p/mcollective-plugins/wiki/AgentRegistrationMonitor Registration Monitor] agent, look in _/var/tmp/mcollective_ for meta data from all your nodes.

The current AMI has 1 x left over file there from when I was building the AMI.
