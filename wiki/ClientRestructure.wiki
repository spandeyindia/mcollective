#summary Dumping ground for ideas about new client libs

= Introduction =

We want to make a standard data exchange format between clients and agents, you wont *have* to use it but it will go a long way towards writing generic clients.

Today almost every agent and client impliments their own little weird exchange of info and data, this makes it hard to do generic clients, other languages etc.

The idea is that we could write a CLI tool like:

{{{
$ mc-call-agent --agent exim --action setsender --data msgid=1-2-3-4 --data sender="foo@bar"
}}}

The output should then be a print of each host response in a human parsable format - even pp output is parsable.

With this in place we'd be able to make generic web based and cli based tools easier, and ultimately make it easier to write task specific clients too.
