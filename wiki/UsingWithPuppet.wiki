#summary Using Puppet with MCollective

= Introduction =

If you're a Puppet user you are supported in both facts and classes filters.

= Facts =
There is a [FactsRLFacter community plugin to enable Facter] as a fact source.

So you can use the facts provided by Facter in filters, reports etc.

{{{
$ mc-find-hosts --with-fact lsbdistrelease=5.4
}}}

This includes facts pushed out with [http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/PluginsInModules Plugin Sync].
 
= Class Filters =
Puppet provides a list of classes applied to a node by default in _/var/lib/puppet/classes.txt_, we'll use this data with _--with-class_ filters.

You should configure MCollective to use this file by putting the following in your _server.cfg_

{{{
classesfile = /var/lib/puppet/classes.txt
}}}

You can now use your classes lists in filters:

{{{
$ mc-find-hosts --with-class /apache/
}}}
