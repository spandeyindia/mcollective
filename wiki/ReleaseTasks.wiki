# cd marionette-collective
# git checkout 0.x.x
# rake rpm
}}}

Copy the RPMs and test it.

== Building debs ==
Boot up an instance of _ami-0db89079_ and do more or less the following:

*Note: There's some bug, you might need to run _make deb_ twice to make it work*

{{{
# apt-get update
# apt-get install rake irb rdoc build-essential subversion devscripts dpatch cdbs rubygems git-core
# git clone git://github.com/mcollective/marionette-collective.git
# cd marionette-collective
# git checkout 0.x.x
# rake deb
