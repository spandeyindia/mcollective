= Introduction =

*Note: This feature is available from 0.4.3 onwards*

As part of the [SimpleRPCIntroduction SimpleRPC] framework we've added an auditing system that you can use to log all requests received into a file or even send it over mcollective to a central auditing system.  What actually happens with audit data is pluggable and you can provide your own plugins to do what you need.

The clients will include the _uid_ of the process running the client library in the requests and the audit function will have access to that on the requests.

= Configuration =
To enable logging you should set an option to enable it and also one to configure which plugin to use:

{{{
rpcaudit = 1
rpcauditprovider = Logfile
}}}

This sets it up to use _MCollective::Audit::Logfile_ plugin for logging evens.

The client will embed a caller id - the Unix UID of the program running it or SSL cert - in requests which you can find in the _request_ object.

= Logfile plugin =

Auditing is implemented using plugins that you should install in the normal plugin directory under _mcollective/audit/_.  We have a sample Logfile plugin that you can see below:

{{{
module MCollective
    module RPC
        class Logfile<Audit
            def audit_request(request, connection)
                logfile = Config.instance.pluginconf["rpcaudit.logfile"] || "/var/log/mcollective-audit.log"

                File.open(logfile, "w") do |f|
                    f.puts("#{request.uniqid}: #{request.time} caller=#{request.caller}@#{request.sender} agent=#{request.agent} action=#{request.action}")
                    f.puts("#{request.uniqid}: #{request.data.pretty_print_inspect}")
                end
            end
        end
    end
end
}}}

As you can see you only need to provide one method called _audit_request_, you will get the request in the form of an _MCollective::RPC::Request_ object as well as the connection to the middleware should you wish to send logs to a central host.

The Logfile plugin takes a configuration option:

{{{
plugin.rpcaudit.logfile = /var/log/mcollective-audit.log
}}}

We do not do log rotation of this file so you should do that yourself if you enable this plugin.

This log lines like:

{{{
9170b825005d47d66a86efe23ebaa106: 1263939135 caller=uid=500@devel.your.com agent=service action=status
9170b825005d47d66a86efe23ebaa106: {:service=>"httpd"}
}}}
